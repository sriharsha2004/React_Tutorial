Why react ??
A react is a single page application (SPA) unlike others , that means it requests the server , 
to get the page only once(index.html) later when ever user wants to navigate to other pages ,
this request will not be handled by server , the react itself handles the new requests and 
changes the pages , based on the route that user wanna access .

React consists of react-router which intercepts all the requests of the server (prevents 
the requests to the server) and informs the react to render the components ,
that means the the request is send ti sever only once, and to handle furhtur requests , it
will be handled by react-router and react.
