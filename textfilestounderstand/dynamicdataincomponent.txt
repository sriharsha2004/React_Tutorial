Inside the components we can also write Javascript this needds to be writterned before return()
and inorder to access the data present inside the javascipt into the return( ) block 
we use curly braces {} to include data inside the jsx.
Note : By default react will take data from js and automatically converts it onto a string and 
places them into curly braces irrespective of number,array etc.. 
eg : if we use { [1,2,3,4] } inside the jsx it outputs as 1234 in browser 
booleans and objects cannot be placed in the return() using curly braces .
we can write any kind of valid javaScript inside the curly braces .
we can also include a dynamic href fro a tag in return() block
