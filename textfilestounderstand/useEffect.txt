Useeffect hook is a hook which takes a function as an argument which gets executed when ever 
a template is rendered into the page ,
i.e it executes the function soon after starting the program , because initally their will
be some contents which will be rendered (blogs in our case)
and also when ever a blog is deleted it will again execute the statemtns inside the function
of Useeffect hook , as when we delete a blog then it will set the blogs using useState hook ,
hencec it is again going to re-render tempalte , hence it execute the statements of 
use Effect hook function again .

but if we want to execute the function in useEffect hook only sometimes , we use second argument 
in which we specify the dependencies ,
if dependency array is specified as an empty array , then it executes the funciton in useEffect 
only once at the starting when template is rendered at starting
we can also specify the set of hooks for which we want to execute the fucntion in useEffect .
eg :
useEffect(()=>{
    //function defination
},[name])
this function inside useEffect will only be executed when the name hook changes its state .
