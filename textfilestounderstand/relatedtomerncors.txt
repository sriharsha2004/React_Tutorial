cors stands for cross origin resource sharing , it is a type of error which is mainly caused
when ever the frontend development server is working on certain port number ,
and backend server is running on some other port number and if we request the 
server(which is runnning on different port) from frontend then it causes cors error.

we can handle this error in two ways ,
we can install a nodemodule known as cors in the backend and use an additional middleware in app.js
app.use(cors())

we can also add a proxy in the package.json file present inside the frontend , And assign
the proxy to the respective port number of the backend server.

eg:if frontend developmetn server i.e react is working on port number 3000 , if the server at
the backend is listening to port number 4000 , it causes a cors error .
add the below line in package.json file inside the fronend .

add this in the first line of package.json file in the frontend side
"proxy" : "http://localhost:4000",
