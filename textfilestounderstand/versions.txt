while doing project we might face several issues and errors and resolve all these issues searching
in the stackoverflow and other websites .
after creating a react app , degrade the version of react app using the following command
npm install --save react@17.0.1 react-dom@17.0.1
then only few fuccntions will work like Link tag you are using will not work of react-dom is 
verison 18 and above 
and after downgrading the version repplace the code in index.js with below code
change one imported statemtn as (import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; remove client from it )

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

Also downgrade the version of react-router-dom to ^5.2.0 using (npm i react-router-dom@5.2.0)
So that Switch works

Follow the above instructions strictly otherwise you are going to face several issues related
to versions and errors .....
