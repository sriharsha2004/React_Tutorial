In this we are extracting the data from the the json file insteard of using database ,
for that purpose we created a file called as data folder and then include db.json file ,
and create a rest api from that data using the bellow command ,
then using the fetch we fetch the blogs data insteard of declaring statically inside the 
compnenent .
command -> npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
data/db.json is the path where the data is available
after executing this command we get the api localhost....
now we can fetch the data from this new api which is obtained .
