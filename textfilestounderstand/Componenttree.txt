We know that app is the component which is rendered into index.html from index.js file .
Hence app component is said to be the root component for the component tree 
The way in whihch app component is included in index.js , in the same way we can include the
componnts inside the app components andd furthur inside this component we can add more componners
hence it forms a component tree 

component tree :
            app 
    header  middle  footer
      |        |        |
    navbar  blogs    copyrights

Note : when we add css to any of the component automaticcally thr same css applies to all the 
components which are displayed in that page .
It is because all the css files will be added into index.html file (inspect the console to understand)

We can also give inline css , we need to give it inside the object -> {}
and this object nneds to be included inside another braces -> {} as we are in jsx 
so <div style = {{
    color : "white"
}}></div>

the outer brace is for dynamic , inner is a object inside which we need to give css ;
