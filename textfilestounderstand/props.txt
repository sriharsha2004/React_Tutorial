props are the ones which are maily used to tracsfer the data from one component to 
other component  ,
for example  : if we want to loop through all the blogs in various locations , we need to 
declare the same blogs array at diffreent locations which is time consuming and not a 
good approach to do it ,
hence inorder to optimize it we can use props , so that we can traccsfer data from one
compnentn to other compnetnt blogs array in this case , 
and we can direclty get ht access to blogs array in other component hence we can loop through
it when ever required .
Note : props are used to transfer the data from the parent component to its child componentss.

we pass the required data through the componenet it self,
and in the other components all the data will be stored in an object known as props ,
now we can access what ever data we want from props
for reference refer to Home.js and bloglist.js components .
